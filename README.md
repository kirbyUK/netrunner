# netrunner

Python library and scripts for interacting with various Netrunner services.

**If you've never run any Python before, please read the [beginner's guide](https://github.com/kirbyUK/netrunner/blob/master/BEGINNERS-GUIDE.md) to get started.**

## Library

The library has a few components:

* `netrunner.alwaysberunning`: Wrapper for [AlwaysBeRunning.net](https://alwaysberunning.net/) for getting tournaments and results
* `netrunner.netrunnerdb`: Wrapper for [NetrunnerDB](https://netrunnerdb.com/) for getting card and decklist data

## Scripts

There are scripts within this repository to perform useful tasks. Each has it's own documentation.
